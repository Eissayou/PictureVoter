Starting off, this project was started in Replit but was then moved over to VSCode on my regular computer due to issues with connecting Replit with a database. 
Steps for running this project:
1. Start virtual environment by ".\env\Scripts\activate"
2. If anything needs to be installed do "pip install django mysql mysql-connector-python"
3. MySql needs to be downloaded to the computer and that has to be configured. 6:45 of this video shows how to do it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t10QcFx7d5k
4. Run the command "python manage.py runserver"
5. The project should be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
